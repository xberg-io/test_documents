## Apple iWork fixtures (`iwork/`)

- **Source:** existing Xberg test corpus, present since corpus commit `c55c3b48ba29634d097c84cda220929a083e4553`.
- **Original upstream/license:** not recorded in the import history; no external source is inferred here.
- **Used here:** `test.pages`, `test.key`, and `test.numbers`.
- **Modifications:** none to the source files. Pages and Keynote GT comes from their sole length-delimited UTF-8 IWA
  payloads; Numbers GT uses Apple QuickLook and the package's matching application-generated preview as independent
  visual oracles.

## ds4sd/DocLayNet (IBM)

- **Citation:** Pfitzmann et al., "DocLayNet: A Large Human-Annotated Dataset for Document-Layout Analysis", KDD 2022.
- **Source:** <https://huggingface.co/datasets/ds4sd/DocLayNet-v1.1>
- **License:** CDLA-Permissive-1.0
- **Used here:** 2 financial-report pages (`images/doclaynet_page_01..02.jpg`) from the `test` split (`NASDAQ_ATRI_2003.pdf` p24, `NYSE_MGM_2004.pdf` p49).
- **Modifications:** authoritative PDF text cells linearized in reading order (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right). No OCR and no model used; text is DocLayNet's verbatim PDF-layer cell text.

## Diagram fixtures (this repository)

- **Source:** authored here, not derived from any third-party dataset. The first four Graphviz fixtures were contributed by Parman Mohammadalizadeh (@MannXo) in xberg-io/test_documents#1.
- **License:** same as this repository.
- **Used here:** `diagrams/svg/*.svg` and `diagrams/pdf/*.pdf` plus their `diagrams/src/*.{dot,mmd,puml,fodg,html}` sources, `diagrams/manifest.json`, and `ground_truth/dot/*.dot`.
- **Rendering tools:** the source graphs are ours; the SVGs and PDFs are what each renderer emitted from them. Graphviz 15.1.1 (`dot`/`neato`) is EPL-1.0, Mermaid CLI 11.16.0 is MIT, PlantUML 1.2026.0 is GPL, LibreOffice 26.2.5.2 is MPL-2.0, librsvg 2.62.3 (`rsvg-convert`) is LGPL-2.1-or-later, qpdf 12.3.2 is Apache-2.0, and Google Chrome 151 is proprietary. None of these licenses reaches the output: rendering a document is not a derivative work of the renderer, and PlantUML says so explicitly in its FAQ. No tool binary, jar or stylesheet is redistributed here.
- **Embedded fonts:** a PDF carries subsetted glyph outlines of whatever fonts the renderer reached for, so the fixtures under `diagrams/pdf/` do redistribute font data. Each family was checked against the OS/2 `fsType` bit of the system font it came from, which is where a font states its own embedding terms: Helvetica and Liberation Sans report 0 (installable, no restriction), Times New Roman and Trebuchet MS report 8 (editable embedding). All four permit it. `scripts/build_diagram_pdfs.py` holds that allowlist and fails a build that reaches for anything outside it. That check is why `graphviz_cjk` ships as SVG only: macOS's Songti reports `fsType` 2, restricted, which forbids embedding without the owner's permission, so no CJK PDF is published until an open-licensed CJK face is available to render one.
- **Modifications:** every fixture whose producer states its own graph also ships as a `*_geometry.svg` variant with that metadata removed by `scripts/strip_svg_graph_metadata.py` — Graphviz writes the node ids and the full edge list into `<title>` elements and again into XML comments; Mermaid into `id="L_start_auth_0"`, again into `data-id`, and the edge's waypoints into `data-points`; PlantUML into `id="Read config-to-Open input"`, again into a comment, again into a `data-entity-1`/`data-entity-2` pair, and once more into a `<?plantuml-src?>` processing instruction carrying its whole deflated source; and LibreOffice by tagging each group with its shape kind, which across a whole file is the node/edge partition. A fixture that names its own answer cannot measure geometry recovery. Stripping removes no geometry: each variant renders to a byte-identical PNG. `nested_transforms.svg`, `icon_nodes.svg`, `mixed_page.svg`, `two_diagrams.svg` and the three `negative_*.svg` files are hand-written. Ground truth is the source graph restated by node label, so it is independent of any recogniser's numbering.

## xberg math corpus

- **Citation:** assembled for xberg from published documents that carry mathematics, one per notation and container the extractor supports.
- **Source:** 123 upstream projects and publishers. Each document's source URL is in `MATH_PROVENANCE.md`.
- **License:** per document. 136 are vendored under permissive terms, chiefly MIT (36), CC-BY-4.0 (25), Apache-2.0 (21), US public domain (13), BSD-3-Clause (12) and MPL-2.0 (5). Four state a dual `CC-BY OR GPL-3.0-or-later` licence and are taken under the CC-BY arm. 12 carry ShareAlike, GPL or GFDL terms and are reference only, recorded without their bytes.
- **Used here:** 136 documents vendored, 12 reference.
- **Modifications:** none. Each document is byte-identical to what its publisher serves, so a fixture measures the real file rather than a rewritten one. No ground truth is derived from them here.

- **Source:** <https://en.wikipedia.org>
- **License:** CC-BY-SA-4.0. ShareAlike is copyleft, so these are reference only.
- **Used here:** 178 mathematics articles, reference.
- **Modifications:** none.

## Synthetic scanned math pages

- **Citation:** none; generated for this corpus.
- **Source:** rendered with matplotlib mathtext, rasterized at 300 DPI, binarized, and packed as CCITT G4 PDFs with no text layer, to mirror the shape of a scanned textbook page (xberg issue #1385).
- **License:** MIT, as our own work.
- **Used here:** `pdf_scanned/synthetic_math_*.pdf`, four pages that carry display equations only as pixels. They exercise formula detection and recognition on scanned input, including a skewed scan.
- **Modifications:** not applicable.

## xberg benchmark-harness fixtures

- **Citation:** none; part of the xberg repository.
- **Source:** <https://github.com/xberg-io/xberg>, `tools/benchmark-harness/fixtures/split/memo_marketing_form.pdf`, page 1, rasterized at 300 DPI and packed as a bilevel CCITT G4 scan.
- **License:** MIT, as our own work.
- **Used here:** `pdf_scanned/memo_prose_scanned.pdf`, the negative case: a scanned page with no mathematics, which must yield no formulas.
- **Modifications:** rasterized and binarized from the vector original.

## Xberg issue #1484 two-column gutter reproduction

- **Source:** authored by Eric Evers (`@erichevers`) and attached to
  <https://github.com/xberg-io/xberg/issues/1484> as a minimal reproduction.
- **License:** MIT, as a contribution to the Xberg test corpus.
- **Used here:** `pdf/issue-1484-two-column-hanging-number-gutter.pdf`, a two-page A4 fixture whose
  first page uses hanging clause numbers and whose unnumbered second page is the control.
- **Modifications:** renamed for stable corpus addressing; document bytes are otherwise unchanged.

## City of Sugar Land, Texas — Ordinance No. 2197

- **Citation:** City of Sugar Land, Texas, Ordinance No. 2197 (adopted 4 August 2020), a zoning change for approximately 0.7906 acres at Lake Pointe Parkway and Creek Bend Drive.
- **Source:** City of Sugar Land public records.
- **License:** US public domain. Texas municipal ordinances are edicts of government and carry no copyright.
- **Used here:** `pdf_scanned/ordinance_2197_scanned.pdf`, a 16-page office-scanner capture (Xerox AltaLink C8045, JBIG2 masks over JPEG backgrounds) with no text layer. It pairs long-form legal prose with signature blocks, a recorded survey plat, and six architectural exhibit sheets whose labels are rotated 90 degrees, so it exercises OCR reading order across mixed upright and landscape content.
- **Modifications:** none to the document. Ground truth in `ground_truth/pdf/ordinance_2197.txt` was produced with PaddleOCR and proofread page by page against 300 DPI renders. It covers the ten prose pages in full, including the handwritten adoption dates; the six drawing sheets are represented only by the printed title-block text that could be read with confidence, since their surveyor and hand-lettered CAD annotations are not legibly transcribable.
